# Caseworker Ecosystem

## What problems are we are trying to find out more about?

### Data Collection and Information Sharing
We are trying to understand how various caseworker collect data, what this data looks like, and how accessible it is to various stakeholders in a child's or juvenile's life. Our assumptions are that data collection is difficult and inconveniently accessible to all stakeholders that need it the most.

### Aging Out of the System
When children exit the foster care system, often they do not have families or the skills to make it on their own. Those systems have resources that they might need but they no longer want to be connected to the court system.

### Obstacles to Family Care
Parents and foster care agencies first try to find a relative to take in the kids. Empowering a family point person if the parent is struggling might be an area to think about. Laws prevent them from problem-solving; they can’t text caseworkers, they can’t communicate with children, and they can’t get information they need.


## Stories
We also want to discover stories of individual who have been able to escape the cycle of negative encounters with child welfare by collecting insight from children who have been in the foster care system, young people who have encountered the juvenile justice system, and mothers who have been evicted from their homes.
