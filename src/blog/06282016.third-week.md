The third week is our second week of design sprints and I led a sprint with another design partner. We explored the idea of legal health within the family court system and through our research, discovered a specific kind of emotional sensitivity on the subject. The DIG members that we talked to, two mothers who had gone through family court, revealed to us the permanent impact that the process has on the families mental and emotional health. Another story came from a young man who's parents went through the family court when he was a child. He ended up partially being raised by family members and foster homes.
