My experience ranges from research with human-centered design to prototyping and implementation using identity design, user experience design, interface design, front-end web development, and data visualization. Most recently, I co-founded a financial data startup called Quadrant.io. Working at an early stage company gave me the opportunity to innovate and work directly with our audience as well as insight into the perspectives of entrepreneurs and the unique challenges they face. As a designer and engineer, I have come up against many challenges, both creative and technical, and I derive a great deal of satisfaction overcoming them. Some of the most important skills I’ve learned through being challenged include listening to people’s needs, finding insight to supplement knowledge, addressing technical debt, strategizing for successful outcomes, and collaborating with all stakeholders.","sections":[]},{"head":["Experience"],"text":[],"sections":[{"head":["Design Technologist, Sole Proprietor at exp. design","May 2009 - Present","(7 years)"],"text":"I provide brand strategy and full-stack web development services developing identities, stationary, posters, marketing websites, application interfaces, and data visualizations using my skills in Identity/Branding, User Experience Design, User Interface Design, and User Interface Engineering."},{"head":["Co-Founder, Chief Design Technologist at Quadrant.io","May 2014 - December 2015","(1 year 8 months)"],"text":"Quadrant.io is a toolkit that provides macroeconomic data.
